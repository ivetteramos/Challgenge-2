# Module-2-Challenge

## Description 

I have created my very beginner portfolio from scratch. It includes links to my Horiseon website as well as 3 different forms to contact me. All of my links redirect you to the correct area. I also added a picture of myself and a placeholder. My application contains live URL to my website and GitHub. When I resize to mobile the page moves with it.
